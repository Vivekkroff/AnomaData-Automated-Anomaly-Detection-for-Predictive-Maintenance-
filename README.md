# AnomaData-Automated-Anomaly-Detection-for-Predictive-Maintenance-

Project Overview
AnomaData is a capstone project focused on building a predictive maintenance solution aimed at detecting anomalies that can lead to machine breakdowns. This solution leverages machine learning techniques to analyze time series data, identify patterns, and predict potential failures. By proactively identifying anomalies, this system helps in reducing risks and improving operational efficiency.

Problem Statement
In various industries, unexpected machine failures can lead to significant downtime and financial losses. Predictive maintenance aims to mitigate these risks by analyzing equipment data to detect potential issues before they lead to failure. This project involves building a model that can predict such anomalies using historical data with binary labels indicating the presence of anomalies.

Project Structure
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and understand the dataset, identify patterns, and prepare the data for modeling.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize the data.
Feature Engineering: Create and select features to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Identify the most suitable model for anomaly detection.
Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and train the model.
Model Validation: Evaluate the model on the test data to assess its generalization ability.
Model Deployment Plan: Outline steps for deploying the model in a production environment.
Success Metrics
Model Accuracy: The model should achieve an accuracy of over 75% on the test dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Include methods for improving the modelâ€™s performance.
Model Validation: Perform thorough validation to ensure the model's robustness.
